Contoso BadgeMeUp is a SaaS B2B application that Contoso sells to companies that want a great tool to improve the culture within their organization.

> For more information about how this SaaS architecture compares to others, please see *Scenario 1* in [SaaS Branding Considerations](../branding-considerations-for-saas/#scenario-1---pure-b2b).

Lucerne Publishing has recently purchased Contoso BadgeMeUp. They're currently using Azure Active Directory and want their employees to be able to Single Sign-on to BadgeMeUp.

> Note: Contoso IT has configured their B2C instance for an external authentication provider. Additional documentation is available [here]([Set up sign-in for multi-tenant Azure AD by custom policies - Azure AD B2C | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/identity-provider-azure-ad-multi-tenant?pivots=b2c-user-flow)).
