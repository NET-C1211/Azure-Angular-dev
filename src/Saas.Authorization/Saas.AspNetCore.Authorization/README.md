# About
This library is useful if you have a multi tenant ASP.NET application with users potentially having 
different roles in different tentants.
## Goals
- Easy to use for developers
- Integrate with ASP.NET authorization libraries
- Use REST conventions apply authorization rules
- Leverage OAuth/OIDC but allow alternate approaches
- Allow users to have different roles depending on the context (subscription, organization, etc)

## Approach
- Add custom roles in the form of {contxt}.Role to users ID_Token
- Provide extensions for the application to be able to authorize based out route components (context)

# How to use
## ClaimToRoleTransformer
*ClaimToRoleTransofrmer* is used to convert custom claims that are added to users ID_Token into roles that are 
compatible with ASP.NET authorization.  This way you can use roles that your identity provider adds to the token 
for authorization.  For example if you are using AADB2C you can enrich your tokens from an external source using 
an [API connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-api-connector-token-enrichment).  This way 
they can be validated and processed using the same tools.

Will generate a new ClaimsPrincipal that has an additional identity with the added roles.

### To enable:
Add the settings to your appsettings.json
```json
  "ClaimToRoleTransformer": {
    "SourceClaimType": "extension_CustomClaim", //Name of the claim custom roles are in
    "RoleClaimtype": "MyCustomRoles",           //Type of the claim to use in the new Identity (works along side of built in)
    "AuthenticationType" : "MyCustomRoleAut"    //If you need to change the Authentication type for new identity
  }
```
And add this to your application startup (ther are other overrides but this is recommended)
```C#
builder.Services.AddClaimToRoleTransformer(builder.Configuration, "ClaimToRoleTransformer");
```

## Route based policy requirement
This compnent allows you to write policies that can understand context based roles.  

For example given the following policy for a subscription with ID ```subscription_1```:
```C#
    options.AddPolicy("SubscriptionAdminOnly", policyBuilder =>
    {
        policyBuilder.Requirements.Add(new RouteBasedPolicyRequirement("subscriptionId", "SubscriptionAdmin"));
    });
```  
And this action method:
```C#
[Authorize(Policy = "SubscriptionAdminOnly")]
[Route("subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/users")]
public IActionResult GetUsersSubAdminPolicy(string subscriptionId)
{
    return View();
}
```
Will allow only users with ```subscription_1.SubscriptionAdmin``` role to access this view.

### To enable:
Add the following to your application startup to be able to use _RouteBasedPolicyRequirement_ in your policies
```C#
builder.Services.AddHttpContextAccessor();
builder.Services.AddRouteBasedPolicy();
```


### Route based role handler
If you are not using policies and authorizing by roles at the action methods __(not preffered)__ you can use the 
_RouteBasedPolicyHandler_ to evaluate roles based on the route for the request also.

For example given the following registeration for a subscriptionwith ID ```subscription_2```:
```C#
builder.Services.AddRouteBasedRoleHandler("subscriptionId");
```
And this action method:
```C#
[Authorize(Roles = "SystemAdmin, SubscriptionAdmin")]
[Route("subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/Admins")]
public IActionResult GetUsersAdmin(string subscriptionId)
{
    return View();
}
```
Will allow only users with ```subscription_2.SubscriptionAdmin``` __or__ ```subscription_2.SystemAdmin``` __or__ ```SubscriptionAdmin``` __or__ ```SystemAdmin``` 
to access the view.

### To enable:
Add the following to your application startup:
```C#
builder.Services.AddHttpContextAccessor();
builder.Services.AddRouteBasedRoleHandler("subscriptionId");  //You can add more handlers if you use different route components
```
